# :radioactive: Step Away!
## :eyes: Just another screen break app
"Step away" typically means to physically remove oneself from a situation or environment in order to take a break, clear one's head, or gain perspective.

This is a simple screen break program that shows you a blank screen with a physical exercise to remind you to take breaks and move.

## :rocket: Features
- Configure a short break interval and duration
- Configure a long break interval and duration
- System tray icon controls (Pause, Resume, Skip, Skip to long, Stop)
- Add Ubuntu desktop icon (See [Setup](#setup-ubuntu))

## :warning: Works on
- Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
- Windows 10

## :mag: Setup

<a name="setup-ubuntu"></a>
### Ubuntu
```
mkdir -p ~/code && cd ~/code
git clone git@github.com:jaystewartcouk/step-away.git
cd step-away
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp step_away.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/step_away.desktop
sed -i 's#/path/to/your/#'"$HOME/code/"'#g' ~/.local/share/applications/step_away.desktop
```

## :sunglasses: Usage
`python step_away.py`

```
usage: step_away.py [-h] [--short_break_frequency_minutes SHORT_BREAK_FREQUENCY_MINUTES] [--short_break_length_seconds SHORT_BREAK_LENGTH_SECONDS]
                    [--long_break_frequency_minutes LONG_BREAK_FREQUENCY_MINUTES] [--long_break_length_minutes LONG_BREAK_LENGTH_MINUTES] [--delay DELAY]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --short_break_frequency_minutes SHORT_BREAK_FREQUENCY_MINUTES
                        (Needs to go evenly into long_break_frequency_minutes)
  --short_break_length_seconds SHORT_BREAK_LENGTH_SECONDS
  --long_break_frequency_minutes LONG_BREAK_FREQUENCY_MINUTES
                        (Needs to be a multiple of short_break_frequency_minutes)
  --long_break_length_minutes LONG_BREAK_LENGTH_MINUTES
  --delay DELAY
